- name: Video Summarizer
  descr: I Implemented the Detect-to-Summarize network (DSNet), the state-of-art framework for supervised video summarization using anchor-based and anchor-free approaches in PyTorch.

    - tag: Python

- name: Sentiment Analysis
  descr: I customized the performance of a pre-existing Distilbert model on a tailored dataset for the purpose of sentiment analysis. My implementation integrated the use of FAST API and hugging face libraries, including transformers and pipeline, in PyTorch

- name: Far Distant Object Detection
  descr: I developed an innovative method for detecting people standing at a distance for intelligent railway system surveillance. I employed modified Hough transformation algorithms to detect railway tracks, utilized HSV segmentation to remove noise from images, and incorporated the modified Faster RCNN method with the appropriate anchor size at the RCNN pipeline. Furthermore, I implemented an upsampling technique to magnify the image at the RPN funnel of RCNN to ensure that it is processed in subsequent layers of the network.

- name: Human Activity Recognition - HAR
  descr: I conducted a classification task on five different types of exercises using the Weightlifting Exercises Database. The process involved analyzing features, imputing missing values, modeling with Random Forest, and reducing prediction error, resulting in a high-performing model with an out-of-sample error of only 0.00118
